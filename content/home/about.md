My name is Jie Feng and I am a Junior student from Mixed Honor Class in Chu Kochen Honors College at Zhejiang University, an Honor Program for top 5% students at Zhejiang University. I major in Control Science and Engineering.

My research interests lie in robotics, computer vision and optimization. My ambition is to develop intelligence for robot that can learn with little supervision. And I did a lot to chase my goal. My first scientific project is Multi-information Fusion Ontology For Robot Autonomous Programming, in which we use videos, images and sound to build an graph structure ontology database to learn the instructions of making salads.  
To have a better understanding of cutting-edge machine learning technique, I joined Tucodec as a reseach intern. My main contribution are the post-processing model optimization and data processing. I also tried several warping methods to boost our performance. In the end, our solution showed promising results and we won the challenge. I wrote the paper and as champion we get the oral oppotunity.

As my ontology database mentioned above doesn't have reasoning ability, which is vital for robot intelligence, I joined a research group to get more insights of graph structured data. We design coarsening and partitioning algorithms and corresponding architectures to analyse similarity between relatively big graphs, our methods showed better or equally good performance of existing GNN methods with improved speed. Our papers will be submitted to nips, cikm and other top conferences. 

In the summer, I will join UCB MSC Lab to do some research about automous driving as a research intern.
I am looking forward to a PhD position enrolled in fall 2021.
