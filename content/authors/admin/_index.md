Hi, I am Jie Feng, a senior undergraduate student in Zhejiang University.

I study in the Mixed Honor Class in Chu Kochen Honors College at Zhejiang University, an Honor Program for top 5% students at Zhejiang University. 

My major is Control Science and Engineering and I am advised by Prof. [Rong Xiong](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/rongxiong#776514). I am also a research assistant in [MSC lab](https://msc.berkeley.edu/), working closely with Prof. [Tomizuka](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/masayoshi-tomizuka/), Post Doc. [Wei Zhan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xVN3UxYAAAAJ&hl=en) and Post Doc. [Liting Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=BitIg-YAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Previously, I worked as a research intern at [Tucodec](https://www.tucodec.com/) and won CVPR CLIC 2020 championship in P-frame track.

In the next few months, I am fortune to have the opportunity to work closely with Prof. [Yuke Zhu](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~yukez/). 

I am looking for a PhD position enrolled in fall 2021, and my CV is on the left. I am actively seeking for collaborations and opportunities. Feel to reach out if you are interested in my research.

Research Interests:

* Unsupervised or semi-supervised robot learning methods
* Interpretable models, especially for planning
* Representation learning, Graph Neural Networks
