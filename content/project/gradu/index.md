In this project, I will design a benchmark for grasping deformable objects, which is a challenging problem for robotics. I will begin with Mujoco physical engine, make the graphics and then test the main-stream robot learning methods. If I have time, I am interested in developing general purpose robot learning methods which can apply to most exsiting benchmarks.
